# Historical-Automobile-Sales-Analysis

# Overview: 
This project focuses on analyzing historical automobile sales data to identify key factors influencing sales trends, including economic conditions, competition, and advertising expenditure. The dataset spans from 1980 to 2023, covering 528 monthly records with variables such as Price, Automobile Sales, GDP, and Consumer Confidence.

# Data Source: 
The dataset was sourced from a project within the IBM Developer Skills Network as part of a Data Analytics certification course, ensuring the data is reliable and relevant for in-depth analysis.

# Key Features:

# Data Wrangling & Preprocessing:

•	Cleaned and formatted a dataset of 528 entries using Python's Pandas library.

•	Filtered and sliced the data for specific rows and columns, focusing on key metrics like automobile sales, price, and economic indicators.

•	Created new features such as High_Sales based on automobile sales thresholds to identify high-performing periods.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•	Trend Analysis: Examined the trend of automobile sales over the years, highlighting the impact of recessions.

•	Seasonality Effects: Assessed how seasonal changes influence sales, with visualizations showing peak sales periods in specific months.

•	Competition Impact: Analyzed how varying levels of market competition affect automobile sales, identifying potential optimal competition levels for sales maximization.

•	Advertising Effectiveness: Investigated the correlation between advertising expenditure and automobile sales, finding that higher spending doesn't always correlate with higher sales.

•	Economic Indicators: Explored the relationship between GDP, unemployment rates, and automobile prices, revealing the complex interplay of these factors over time.

# Data Visualization:

•	Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to represent trends and correlations within the data.

# Findings:

•	Automobile sales are sensitive to economic conditions, particularly recessions, which significantly reduce sales volumes.
•	There is a noticeable cyclical pattern in sales, with certain months consistently showing higher sales due to seasonality.
•	The effectiveness of advertising expenditure on sales is not straightforward and varies based on additional factors.
•	Competition levels have a nuanced impact on sales, with some optimal levels identified where sales tend to peak.

# Recommendations:
•	Strategic Planning: Utilize insights from seasonality and competition analysis to optimize marketing efforts and inventory management.
•	Economic Resilience: Develop strategies to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on sales.
•	Targeted Advertising: Focus on tailored advertising campaigns rather than just increasing expenditure, ensuring they reach the right audience for maximum impact.
